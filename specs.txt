Cynthia and I played with saving our database schema + data before we left class and were able to clone our repository at home and bring it back. Hereâ€™s how we did it.

at the command prompt, in your project folder, type: pg_dump [database name] -f [filename.sql]
in our case this was: pg_dump to_do -f to_do.sql

now add the file to your git repository and later when you clone or pull it again, you just need to import it.
run psql from your project folder. Create the database name that you want to import the database into:
CREATE DATABASE [database name];
in our case:
CREATE DATABASE to_do;
then switch over to it:
\c to_do
then import it:
\i to_do.sql

You should now have the database with all the data you left off with.
